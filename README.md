# Jakarta EE Specification Process

This repository contains the source content for the Jakarta EE Specification
Process (JESP) and supporting documents.

This JESP is authored by the Jakarta EE Working Group's Specification 
Committee and all new versions must be approved first by the specification
committee and then by the Jakarta EE Working Group's Steering Committee.

Supporting documents may be updated in a more ad hoc manner.
